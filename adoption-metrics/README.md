### All relevant information about defining what exactly we want to track/measue is available in `define_adoption_metrics.md`

- More information about defining the implementation, access to the metrics
  (dashboard / grafana), getting the metrics, implementation details - will
  follow in the future.

### Short summary about the implementation (how it may look like)

Don't take this too seriously - real implementation details will be discused in the future.

- It will be nice to reuse most of the work of Laura's research about monitoring
  [here](https://github.com/packit/research/tree/main/monitoring).
- It may reuse the `/metrics` endpoint described in the link above and took a lot of
  information about metrics from there (and implement new).
- If we decide to go with dashboard - there may be a room for discussion about merging
  or splitting these two types of metrics to dashboard.
