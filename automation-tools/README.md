# Tools/libraries similar or related to the Packit

There are multiple tools with the similar goal to Packit. Here is a list of tools that are similar, related or can be potentially used for some subtasks:

- [tito](./tito.md)
- [rdopkg](./rdopkg.md)
- [rpkg](./rpkg.md) + [rpkg2](./rpkg.md#RPKG2)
- [rpkg-util](./rpkg-util.md)
- [dlrn](./dlrn.md)

[Here](https://pagure.io/rpkg/issue/49) is a discussions about creating a new rpkg, that would be the on, and only one packaging framework and library. ([rpkg2](./rpkg.md#RPKG2) is the follow-up from that discussion.)
