# Making decisions in our projects

We'd like to have a predictable way of making decisions so that we are not
blocked on picking vim over emacs. I mean solution A over solution B.

## [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/blob/master/ODF-community.md)

This is the Red Hat's framework for making open, transparent and democratic
decisions in organizations.

We can use it for making large-scale decisions which affect multiple
stakeholders and where implementation would take a considerable effort.
Although that's not what we need here, we need to be able to make quick
democratic decisions within one sprint.

I am amazed that the framework champions these type of questions and suggestions which can help us decide:

- Whose problem are we trying to solve?
- Who else could be impacted?
- Who has solved a similar problem?
- Who is likely to disagree, dissent, reject, or opt out? Who else may care?
- Gather input from internal customers and those who you will need help from (surveys, interviews, focus groups, etc.)
- Remain open to new information and perspectives
- Consider peer-to-peer feedback and communication options in addition to formal channels
- How will we monitor mailing lists and other feedback channels after the launch?
- How willing are we to make revisions based on feedback?
- What's a reasonable window of time for additional input and refinement?
- Did we overlook something important? How do we address it?

## [FESCo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/)

Decisions in FESCo are the daily bread so we can get an inspiration here. They have a well-thought voting mechanism:

- One week for FESCo members to vote `+1` or `-1`. After the period accept if 3 `+1`s were received without a negative vote and vice versa.

- Immediately accept or reject when getting 7 votes of the same type.

- After a week, discuss the topic and decide.

This also sounds like a too complicated solution for us although I like the aspect of: discuss when unsure, accept/reject in agreement.

## [UK Government suggestion for voting in charities](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/charity-meetings-making-decisions-and-voting#follow-voting-rules-if-applicable)

Simple and clear: members cast votes on meetings :) just like we do with grooming.

## ["Board Voting: Common Steps & Tips for Better Decision-Making"](https://boardable.com/blog/board-voting/)

Interesting (and biased) blog post which describes in detail the process of voting in non-profit organizations.

## Proposal

- Use the same type of voting as we do with grooming.

- Everyone has a right to say `+1`, `-1` or `+0` (or `-0`).

- We all need to agree on the preferred choice, meaning we discuss until all cast the same vote.

## Next steps

- [ ] Pick a direction we want to go with.
- [ ] Define guidelines.
- [ ] Try to make a decision on next arch using the guidelines.
